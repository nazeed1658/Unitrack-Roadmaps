                              <h4>Why Android Development ?</h4>
                              <p>So before jumping into the complete Roadmap of Android one should have a clear goal in
                                    his/her mind that why he/she wants to learn Android? Is it for your college academic
                                    projects? or is it for your long-term career? or do you want to build your apps to
                                    start your business? So first make a clear goal. Why do you want to learn Android?
                                    For example, if you want to learn Android for your college Academic projects then
                                    it’s enough to just learn the beginner things in Android. Similarly, if you want to
                                    build your long term career then you should learn the professional or advanced
                                    things also. So it’s on your hand and it’s your decision why you want to learn
                                    Android.

                              <h4>How to Learn Android ?</h4>
                              <p>In Android, programming is done in two languages JAVA or Kotlin and XML(Extension
                                    Markup Language). The XML file deals with the design, presentation, layouts,
                                    blueprint, etc (as a front-end) while the JAVA or KOTLIN deals with working of
                                    buttons, variables, storing, etc (as a back-end). And the biggest confusion for an
                                    Android beginner is which language to choose between Java and Kotlin? So let me try
                                    to overcome the confusion first.</p><br>

                                                      Java is the official language for Android App Development and
                                                      consequently, it is the most used language as well. Many of the
                                                      apps in the Play Store are built with Java and it is also the most
                                                      supported language by Google.The Java programming language can be
                                                      considered as the official language for mobile application
                                                      development. Most of the android applications build using Java.
                                                      The most popular android app development IDE Android Studio also
                                                      uses Java for developing android applications.

                                                      Kotlin is a cross-platform programming language that may be used
                                                      as an alternative to Java for Android App Development. It has also
                                                      been introduced as a secondary “official” Java language in 2017.
                                                      The only sizable difference is that Kotlin removes the superfluous
                                                      features of Java such as null pointer exceptions. It also removes
                                                      the necessity of ending every line with a semicolon. In short,
                                                      Kotlin is much simpler for beginners to try as compared to Java
                                                      and it can also be used as an “entry point” for Android App
                                                      Development.

                              <h4>Android Operating Systems : </h4>
                              <p>The foundation of the Android platform is the Linux kernel, which allows Android to
                                    take advantage of certain security features. The Linux kernel has been used in
                                    millions of security-sensitive systems since its creation in 1991, so it has a long
                                    history of consistently being researched, tested, and improved upon by thousands of
                                    developers.</p>
                              <div class="container1">
                                    <div class="card" style="width: 35rem;">
                                          <img src="images/appDevelopmentPart1.png" class="card-img-top"
                                                alt="image error!">
                                    </div>
                              </div><br>
                              <p>According to the Android docs, Android utilizes several key Linux security features
                                    including:</p>
                              <div class="info">
                                    <li>A user-based permissions model</li>
                                    <li>Process isolation</li>
                                    <li>An extensible mechanism for secure inter-process communication (IPC)</li>
                                    <li>The ability to remove unnecessary and/or insecure parts of the kernel</li>
                              </div><br>
                              <p>Another key feature of Linux is its multiuser operating system, which allows multiple
                                    users to access independent system resources such as memory, CPU resources, RAM, and
                                    applications. By isolating user resources from one another, they can be protected
                                    from each other.</p><br>

                              <h4>Android Platform Architecture : </h4><br>
                              <div class="container1">
                                    <div class="card" style="width: 35rem;">
                                          <img src="images/appDevelopmentPart2.png" class="card-img-top"

                              <p>Android platform architecture consists of six layers built on top of the Linux
                                    Kernel.The actual architecture is stacked in the reverse order of the figure above.
                              </p>
                              <p>Let’s discuss each layer :</p><br>
                              <h5>The Linux Kernel :</h5>
                              <p>The Linux Kernel is the core of the Android platform architecture. It manages low-level
                                    memory and all the available hardware drivers – such as the WiFi driver, camera
                                    driver, audio driver, bluetooth driver, display driver, and all peripheral drivers –
                                    via its Low Memory Killer Daemon.</p><br>
                              <h5>Hardware Abstraction Layout (HAL) :</h5>
                              <p>The hardware abstraction layout (HAL) bridges hardware capabilities to the higher-level
                                    Java API Framework by defining standard interfaces, allowing you to implement the
                                    low-level functionalities without modifying the higher-level systems.</p>
                              <p>HAL implementations are packaged into modules, which are stored as a shared library
                                    (.so file) and loaded by the Android system at the appropriate time.</p><br>
                              <h5>Android Runtime : </h5>
                              <p>Android Runtime (ART) is an application Runtime System used by Android OS and one of
                                    the core features in the Android ecosystem. ART was invented to replace the Dalvik
                                    virtual machine for devices running Android version 5.0 (L​ollipop) or higher.</p>
                              <p>The main role of ART is to execute the Dalvik Executable format (DEX) by translating
                                    DEX bytecode into machine code that your system can understand.</p>
                              <p>ART architecture was written to run multiple virtual machines on low-memory devices.
                                    Some key features are directly related to the speed of running the Android
                                    applications. Key features of ART include:</p>
                              <div class="info">
                                    <li>Ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation</li>
                                    <li>Enhanced garbage collection (GC)</li>
                                    <li>Converting an app package's DEX files to condensed machine code (on Android 9
                                          (API level 28+))</li>
                                    <li>Better debugging support, including detailed diagnostics and crash reporting,
                                          the ability to set multiple watchpoints, and more</li>
                              </div><br>
                              <h5>Native C/C++ Libraries : </h5>
                              <p>The Android platform includes a pair of Native APIs, which work on top of the Native
                                    Development Kit (NDK).</p>
                              <p>The Native APIs let you manage native activities and access physical device components
                                    such as cameras, sensors, graphics, and audio. They are also exposed to the
                                    higher-level layers, so you can control the components of the physical device on the
                                    Java API framework.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>Java API Framework (Application Framework) :</h5>
                              <p>The Java API framework is a collection of Android libraries written in Java and Kotlin
                                    that provide the entire feature-set of the Android OS. Android APIs include an
                                    extensible View System, reusable components, and system managers which are used to
                                    build your Android applications by simplifying the reuse of interfaces.</p>
                              <p>One of the more powerful APIs in the Java API framework is Android Jetpack, which is
                                    pushed by Google. Jetpack accelerates development speed by reducing boilerplate code
                                    so that developers can focus on the code they care about.</p>
                              <p>Also, it provides solutions like Lifecycle, UI toolkit, Navigation, Security, Caching,
                                    Scheduler, Dependency Injection, and a lot more. You’ll cover this deeply in future
                                    posts.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>System Apps : </h5>
                              <p>System apps are pre-installed apps such as email, SNS messaging, calendars, internet
                                    browsing, contacts, and more, which are located in the system partition with your

                              <p>Every Android project must have an AndroidManifest.xml file which describes essential
                                    information about the application such as the package name, entry points,
                                    components, permissions, and metadata.</p><br>
                              <h4>Package Name and Application ID :</h4><br>
                              <p>Every Android project must have a package attribute, which represents your
                                    application’s universally unique application ID in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The
                                    manifest file must be located in your /src/main folder.</p>
                              <div class="container1">
                                    <div class="card" style="width: 35rem;">

                              <p>The package attribute is the only guaranteed way to identify your application on the
                                    Android system (Physical device) and in Google Play. The Android build tools use the
                                    package attribute for the following :</p>
                              <div class="info">
                                    <li>Applying the package name as the namespace for your app resources.</li>
                                    <li>Resolving implicit class names that are declared in the manifest file. For
                                          example, with the above manifest, an activity declared as < activity
                                                android:name=".MainActivity"> is resolved to be
                                                io.getstream.chat.android.ui.MainActivity. So the classes also must be
                                                in the same package folder.</li>
